          What were the chances? It would have to be a lot more than 100 to 1.
          It was likely even more than 1,000 to 1. The more he thought about it,
          the odds of it happening had to be more than 10,000 to 1 and even
          100,000 to 1. People often threw around the chances of something
          happening as being 1,000,000 to 1 as an exaggeration of an unlikely
          event, but he could see that they may actually be accurate in this
          situation. Whatever the odds of it happening, he knew they were big.
          What he didn't know was whether this happening was lucky or unlucky.
          It seemed like it should have been so simple. There was nothing
          inherently difficult with getting the project done. It was simple and
          straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to
          complete it on time, but that wasn't the case. The deadline had
          arrived and the project remained unfinished.
